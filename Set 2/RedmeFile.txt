This Bash script automates the security audit and hardening process for Linux servers. It ensures that the server meets stringent security standards by identifying vulnerabilities and implementing corrective measures.

## Features

- User and group audit
- File and directory permission checks
- Services audit and validation
- Firewall and network security checks
- Public vs private IP identification
- Security updates and patches management
- Log monitoring for suspicious activities
- Server hardening measures (e.g., SSH configuration, bootloader security, IPv6 management)
- Custom security checks via configuration file

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/PoojaKadam14/SafeSquid-Labs.git

chmod +x audit_harden.sh

##Usage
Full Audit and Hardening

sudo ./audit_harden.sh


## Make the Script Executable
Set the appropriate permissions:
chmod +x audit_harden.sh


## Custom Configuration
Edit the custom_checks.conf file to add custom security checks as per your organizationâ€™s policies.

## Reporting and Alerts
The script generates a report after the audit, summarizing all findings and hardening steps. Optional email alerts can be configured for critical issues.

This setup will help automate and standardize the security audit and hardening across your servers.
